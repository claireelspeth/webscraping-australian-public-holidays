# Webscraping Australian Public Holiday Data

Extract Public Holiday Data for Australian States and convert to CSV.

Future development:
* Wrappers for run status
* Regional public holidays - remove/add functions?
* 2020 Show day holidays
* Queen day of mourning holiday
* websites for older years not maintained - wayback machine?
* different formats for different years (code currently limited as to what it can handle)
